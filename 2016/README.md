# Real Molecules
Explore 30 real molecules like alcohol, acid, ether, methane, ethane, ammonia, amines, water...wait 3 s or refresh to speed up, see descr

Generates molecules like alcohol, acid, ether, methane, ethane, ammonia, amines, alkanes, alkanols, water.
Subscript in formula looks best in Firefox, okay in Chrome, worst in IE 11, Edge not tested.

Features:
- Generates 30 real existing unique molecules (bonds checked H:1 O:2 N:3 C:4, double bond in f. acid for O)
- 2.5D Molecule with approx. real atom distances and radius ratio (H < C), angles ~real for most m.
- Chemical empirical formula with subscript
- Molecule name or group name
- Symbol for a characteristic property of the molecule (burnable, toxic, fishy smell... ;)

Update 1:
- Added light reflection effect

Improved after JS1k 2016 submission:
 - removed var assignments for static strings
 - removed function used only once
 - TODO check if merging strings will pay of
 - TODO check a 2nd time if c.globalCompositeOperation couldn't be replaced by changing drawing order
